- 👋 Hi, I’m @immerzen
- 👀 I’m interested in penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the PWK/PEN-200 course and hope to pass my exam in a few months time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to cybersecurity and CTFs. I intend to post some writeups from machines on tryhackme/htb and various CTFs when I'm taking a break from the course.
- 📫 How to reach me: Coming Soon™
